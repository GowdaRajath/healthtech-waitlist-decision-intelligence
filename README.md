# HealthTech Waitlist Decision Intelligence

## Abstract

This project explores how data analytics and machine learning can be used to support transparent, ethical, and data-driven decision-making in healthcare waiting list management.

The system focuses on identifying patient wait-risk patterns, prioritisation signals, and escalation indicators, with the goal of supporting clinical and operational review rather than automating decisions.

All data used in this project is public or synthetic, and the system is designed as a decision-support tool, not a decision replacement.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare systems often manage large and growing waiting lists where:
- Patient risk increases over time
- Prioritisation decisions are complex and multi-factor
- Visibility into wait-risk patterns is limited
- Escalation decisions are often reactive

These challenges can lead to:
- Delayed care for high-risk patients
- Inequitable prioritisation
- Limited transparency for oversight and review

This project investigates how analytics and machine learning can support earlier risk identification and more consistent prioritisation in waiting list management.

---

## Objectives

- Analyse waiting list patterns using structured data
- Identify factors associated with increased wait-risk
- Build interpretable models to support prioritisation
- Design decision-support logic for escalation and review
- Visualise system-level and patient-level risk trends
- Explicitly document ethical and fairness considerations

---

## Scope

This repository focuses on:
- Waiting list analytics
- Risk stratification and prioritisation
- Decision-support logic
- Transparency and explainability
- Ethical use of data in HealthTech contexts

This project does not provide clinical diagnoses or automated decision-making.

## Data Sources

The project uses a combination of:
- Public healthcare datasets (e.g. waiting list statistics)
- Synthetic patient-level data generated for demonstration

No real patient-identifiable data is used.

---

## Ethical Principles

This project is guided by the following principles:
- Decision support, not automation
- Transparency over optimisation
- Explainability over black-box models
- Fairness and bias awareness
- Privacy by design

Ethical considerations and limitations are documented explicitly.

---

## Expected Outputs

- Data ingestion and cleaning pipeline
- Feature engineering for wait-risk analysis
- Interpretable machine learning models
- Decision-support prioritisation logic
- Analytical dashboards and visualisations
- Ethics and bias assessment documentation
